        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>
          I am an undergraduate at the University of Moratuwa with a passion for
          software engineering. I am dedicated to continuous learning and enjoy
          working on projects that solve real-world challenges while fostering
          innovation and collaboration. And also, I am curious about
          neuroscience and its intersection with technology, particularly how
          insights from the brain can inspire advancements in artificial
          intelligence, human-computer interaction, and cognitive computing.
